# Python-Refresher-Journey
## Project Overview
This repository documents my journey refreshing my Python skills. As a professional revisiting Python, I'm summarizing key concepts from each chapter of my study material in clear, simple language. Chapter notes are stored in the `docs/` folder, and related code examples are in the `src/` folder.
