# Python-Refresher-Journey
## Project Overview
This repository documents my journey refreshing my Python skills. As a professional revisiting Python, I'm summarizing key concepts from each chapter of my study material in clear, simple language. Chapter notes are stored in the `docs/` folder, and related code examples are in the `src/` folder.

## Folder Structure
- `docs/`: Contains chapter summaries in Markdown files.
- `src/`: Contains Python code example.

## Getting Started
To explore this repository:
1. Clone it to your local machine.
2. Check the `docs/` folder for chapter summaries (e.g., [docs/1_variables.md](docs/1_variables.md)).
3. Run code examples from the `src/` folder using Python 3.8+ (e.g., `python src/1_variables.py`).
4. No additional setup is required to read the notes.

## Progress
- **Chapter Summaries**:
  - [Chapter 1: Variables](docs/1_variables.md) - Covers creating, using, and updating variables.
  - [Chapter 2: Comments](docs/2_comments.md) - Covers single-line and multi-line comments.
- **Code Examples**:
  - [src/1_variables.py](src/1_variables.py) - Code examples for Variables.
  - [src/2_comments.py](src/2_comments.py) - Code examples for Comments.
  - More code files will be added to `src/` as needed.
